    <h3>â€” Nature Conservation</h3>
    <h1>Technology Healing Mother Nature</h1>

    <p>
        Despite our interest in computers and technology, many members of the Wetfish community are also passionate about nature conservation, permaculture, and homesteading.
        Our mission is to bring back an abundance of biodiversity by accelerating the restoration of entire ecosystems.

    <p>
        We believe that the perception of human technological progression vs nature is a false dichotomy.
        Instead, we're using modern technology to reconnect the public with natural areas and get more young people involved in land management.
